The collections framework 

	  /* The collections framework is a set of classes 
		   * interfaces that provides imoplementation of commonly 
		   * used data structures and algorithms in Java. 
		   * 
		   *  
		   * For example, we can use the LinkedList class of 
		   * the collections framework to implememnt the linked 
		   * list data structure .
		   *   
		   *   
		   *   // Then we are extending that 		
		   *   The use of collections framewokrk makes it reallly easy to 
		   *   implement various data structures and reduces the complexity of writing code. 
		   *   
		   *   
		   *   
		   *   Set - For unique data  
		   *   Map - To store data in key value pairs.  
		   *
