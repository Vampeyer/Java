Abstract Classes notes ,  


 - In the previous example we have created an abstract class Polygon. 
 The class contains an abstract method:getArea() and a non- abstract 
 method 
 printSides(). 
 
 Then we have inherited the Ractangle class from Plygon. AS you can see the 
 rectangle class provides the implementation of the abstract method 
 getArea()
 
 
 Why Abstract methods and classes? 
 
 Abstract classes are created to add features  to other classes. 
 
 For example , the polygon class is not used directly. However , 
 its members are used by the Rectangle subclass. 

** 
 Similarly , declaring the getArea() subclass makes it sure 
 that it must be used by the Rectangle subclass. 
 ** 

 This helps to better understand how classes and methods 
 are used in a project.
